      <description>The podcast I listen to said something like, “I bet Justin Smoak must have one of the lowest BABIPs of anyone to this point in his career.” I thought it might be a good chance to explore this nebulous BABIP a little, what are the historical league and career trends in BABIP. Maybe 3 sentences are needed.
Or maybe a second paragraph. Or 2.

      <description>I just finished my 2017 Reading Challenge on Goodreads. My goal was to read 15 books this year. Poking around the site I discovered that I could export my data. I decided to have a look to see what my reading habits looked like, and since I was doing this for me, I decided to look at my wife’s data too.

      <description>The kids brought home their yearbooks this past week, and it was time to settle a question that I have had for a long time. Do kids who enter their private school at kindergarten do better or worse than the kids who enter later?
Methods At this school there are two honor rolls (Headmaster’s List and Honor Roll). To get Headmaster’s List, a student must achieve a 3.5 grade point average with no grade below a B-.</description>

      <description>I read in the newspaper that the University of Hawaii was recruiting &amp;ldquo;citizen scientists&amp;rdquo; to help document the impact of this week&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;king tides&amp;rdquo; on our coastline. I uploaded some photos to the website but also found that we could download the dataset. I took this as an opportunity to learn something about geographic information systems (GIS) and R, and the end result was a pretty nice map of all the places that were photographed this week.</description>

      <title>Pitchers with More Saves than Strikeouts</title>

      <guid>/2017/05/21/saves-vs-strikeouts/</guid>
      <description>On my favorite fantasy baseball podcast, the host mentioned the phenomenon of pitchers who had more saves than strikeouts. This seemed like it would be fairly uncommon since it seems that many closers are power pitchers (e.g., Aroldis Chapman). I decided to investigate further using the Lahman database.
Methods I used the Lahman database again, which is perfect for answering this kind of questions. It has a Pitching table that contains season long stats for every pitcher from 1871 to 2015 (as of this post).</description>

      <description>My wife and I like iced coffee but drinking it at Starbucks is expensive. I&amp;rsquo;ve been making it myself at home and it&amp;rsquo;s a reasonable facsimile at what I think is a much lower price. I decided to run the calculations to see how much we&amp;rsquo;re saving.
Grounds I tried a bunch of different coffees to see what would work the best: whole bean Kirkland (Costco) brand, whole bean Kona coffee, ground Lion coffee (a local brand), ground Folgers, and ground Kirkland.</description>

      <description>There’s a carnival game at the Iolani Fair called Bank Shot. You have to roll a ball on a ramp into a hole and win a prize. Get it in the green hole and you win tickets, and if you get it in the red hole, you win a big inflatable prize. I wondered what was the rate of hitting the red and green holes.
Here’s a picture of the game layout.</description>

      <description>Last month I went to the American Academy of Pediatrics’ Annual Leadership Forum. This is a meeting of local chapter leaders from across the country where we make resolutions for the AAP to act on. Some resolutions were passed quickly as a group because they were not controversial. This process is called the “consent calendar”. The other resolutions were debated, sometimes at much length, before being voted on individually. At the end of the meeting we came up with the top 10 resolutions that we wanted the AAP to work on this year.</description>

      <guid>/2017/04/18/saves-and-runs-scored/</guid>
      <description>From listening to my favorite fantasy baseball podcast it seems that there is a belief that teams that score lots of runs are not likely to produce saves. The idea seems to be that such teams would blow out their competitors and so have less opportunity for games to be saved. While it made sense, I wondered what the data said.

      <description>My wife’s high school biology students did a lab recently and had difficulty graphing the pooled data. One student allegedly took 2 hours to figure out how to do this in Excel. This seemed like it would be a nice exercise to try in the Hadleyverse. To replicate this plot, I had to take her students’ data in wide form, tidy it up, calculate means for each group and time, and then plot these.</description>

      <description>I was listening to my fantasy baseball podcast last week, and the conversation turned to the Phillies closer situation. One host suggested that the Phillies might not have any pitcher with more than 10 saves this season. The other host thought that this would be unlikely. They looked quickly at the data and found that this has happened a few times since 2000. I wondered if there was a way to look this up using the Lahman database in R.</description>

      <description>In Hawaii, electric cars park for free at state owned parking lots. This is a big benefit when we travel since the airport parking lot is normally $18 per day. I wondered how much money the state loses on the electric car parking at the airport. Because I travel to Maui every week for work, I was able to collect some data to try to answer this question.
Methods I made video recordings of parked cars while driving through the Honolulu International Airport interisland parking structure between November 29, 2016 and December 28, 2016.</description>

      <description>One of my son’s Cub Scout “adventures” requires him to create a scale model of the solar system. We sketched the calculations on the back of a receipt over lunch. We started with the distance we figured that we would use (length of our street, 387 feet) and then calculated the distances to each planet based on this. I figured it would be neat to create a function in R that would return a table of the relative distances based on a given model solar system radius.</description>

First, set up a table of the data. The units for stride length and footprint length are meters.</description>

      <description>I’m studying for my pediatric recertification board exam right now, and to help me remember things, I’m making flashcards as I read an exam study book. Lately, I’ve been wondering how many flashcards I will have by the time I reach the end of the book.
I average about 15 pages a day and about 45 flashcards a day, or 3 flashcards per day. The book itself is 849 pages long, with the real content starting on page 43.</description>

      <title>Reverse-In Parking in Hawaii and California</title>

      <description>Introduction One of my mainland-born friends is annoyed that Hawaii drivers like to reverse their cars into parking stalls much more than the mainland. My wife, who is also from the mainland, agreed with him enthusiastically. Whether this is appropriate parking behavior or not, I had never noticed it before, so I figured it was something I could test with some observations. I had a trip coming up to the mainland, and I was able to collect some data to test whether the Hawaii drivers were really so different than their California counterparts.</description>

      <description>We were fans of Google&amp;rsquo;s Picasa photo organization software, but when it was discontinued, I decided that I would like to transfer all my digital photos onto an external drive and then into Adobe Lightroom. To do so, however, my &amp;ldquo;research&amp;rdquo; told me that it would be best to group them into catalogs based on year, mainly because I have on the order of 10^5 photos.
I had my pictures organized into about 300-400 directories by event.</description>

      <title>Rolling 3 Doubles in Monopoly</title>

      <description>Tonight my two kids and I were playing Monopoly. It’s a terrible, brutal game that usually ends in bad feelings, but for some reason they always want to play it. One of the rules of the game is that if you roll a double (e.g., two 2s), you get another turn. However, if you roll doubles three times in a row, you are sent to jail.
I wondered what was the probability of rolling 3 doubles in a row.</description>

      <description>This is the start of a new blog for me. I mostly completed the Data Science specialization on Coursera and I use some of these skills in work, but still I am just an amateur at this. I hope to use this site as a sort of notebook to document some of my thoughts and keep my already waning programming skills up. Without peer review, I can&amp;rsquo;t vouch for the accuracy of anything I say here, so please don&amp;rsquo;t take anything I write here too seriously!</description>
