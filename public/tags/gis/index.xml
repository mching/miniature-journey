      <description>I read in the newspaper that the University of Hawaii was recruiting &amp;ldquo;citizen scientists&amp;rdquo; to help document the impact of this week&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;king tides&amp;rdquo; on our coastline. I uploaded some photos to the website but also found that we could download the dataset. I took this as an opportunity to learn something about geographic information systems (GIS) and R, and the end result was a pretty nice map of all the places that were photographed this week.</description>
