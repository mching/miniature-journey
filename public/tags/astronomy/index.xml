      <description>One of my son’s Cub Scout “adventures” requires him to create a scale model of the solar system. We sketched the calculations on the back of a receipt over lunch. We started with the distance we figured that we would use (length of our street, 387 feet) and then calculated the distances to each planet based on this. I figured it would be neat to create a function in R that would return a table of the relative distances based on a given model solar system radius.</description>
