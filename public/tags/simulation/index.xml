      <description>The regular fantasy football season just finished, and as usual, my team underperformed. I had the 3rd most points in the league and finished 7 out of 8 teams with a record of 4-8. I wondered what were the chances of such a bad record. This called for a simulation!
Methods I transcribed all the scores for each game into a spreadsheet and loaded it into R.

      <description>Tonight my two kids and I were playing Monopoly. Itâ€™s a terrible, brutal game that usually ends in bad feelings, but for some reason they always want to play it. One of the rules of the game is that if you roll a double (e.g., two 2s), you get another turn. However, if you roll doubles three times in a row, you are sent to jail.
I wondered what was the probability of rolling 3 doubles in a row.</description>
