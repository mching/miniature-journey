      <description>Tonight my two kids and I were playing Monopoly. Itâ€™s a terrible, brutal game that usually ends in bad feelings, but for some reason they always want to play it. One of the rules of the game is that if you roll a double (e.g., two 2s), you get another turn. However, if you roll doubles three times in a row, you are sent to jail.
I wondered what was the probability of rolling 3 doubles in a row.</description>
