      <description>It’s the day after Thanksgiving, and we have data on another turkey. This year our electricity went out just before I was going to put the turkey in our old electric oven so I had to go to my parents’ house to cook the turkey. They just got a fancy new oven with convection roasting, and they claimed it would be faster. This called for an analysis!
Methods Like last year, I took measurements of the probe thermomenter inserted into the deepest part of the breast.</description>

      <description>I’m studying for my pediatric recertification board exam right now, and to help me remember things, I’m making flashcards as I read an exam study book. Lately, I’ve been wondering how many flashcards I will have by the time I reach the end of the book.
I average about 15 pages a day and about 45 flashcards a day, or 3 flashcards per day. The book itself is 849 pages long, with the real content starting on page 43.</description>
