      <description>My wife’s high school biology students did a lab recently and had difficulty graphing the pooled data. One student allegedly took 2 hours to figure out how to do this in Excel. This seemed like it would be a nice exercise to try in the Hadleyverse. To replicate this plot, I had to take her students’ data in wide form, tidy it up, calculate means for each group and time, and then plot these.</description>
