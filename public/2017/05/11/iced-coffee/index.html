<p>My wife and I like iced coffee but drinking it at Starbucks is expensive. I&rsquo;ve been making it myself at home and it&rsquo;s a reasonable facsimile at what I think is a much lower price. I decided to run the calculations to see how much we&rsquo;re saving.</p>

<h2 id="grounds">Grounds</h2>

<p>I tried a bunch of different coffees to see what would work the best: <a href="https://www.costco.com/Kirkland-Signature-House-Blend-Coffee-2-lb%2c-2-pack.product.100232740.html">whole bean Kirkland (Costco) brand</a>, whole bean Kona coffee, ground <a href="http://www.lioncoffee.com/">Lion coffee</a> (a local brand), ground Folgers, and <a href="https://www.costco.com/Kirkland-Signature-Colombian-Coffee-3-lb%2c-2-pack.product.100120060.html">ground Kirkland</a>. I found that the whole bean tended to be too weak, possibly because I didn&rsquo;t grind it finely enough. The ground Folgers is much finer, but it had a lot of residual grit that made it slow to filter.</p>

<p>My favorite has been the <a href="https://www.costco.com/Kirkland-Signature-Colombian-Coffee-3-lb%2c-2-pack.product.100120060.html">pre-ground Kirkland brand</a>. It comes in a 1.36 kg can for about $10. The grind is fine, and it doesn&rsquo;t seem to have too much dust that clogged the filter. It makes a nice dark flavorful brew, and it&rsquo;s hard to beat that price.</p>

<h2 id="extraction">Extraction</h2>

<p>Based on various recipes on the internet (e.g., <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1017355-cold-brewed-iced-coffee">NY Times</a>, <a href="http://www.goodhousekeeping.com/food-recipes/easy/a19854/iced-coffee-recipe/">GH</a>), I place <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> cup (67 g) in a container and pour 3 cups (710 mL) of water over it. I tried steeping it for 12 hours, but this wasn&rsquo;t strong enough for our taste. I steep for 24 hours, and it&rsquo;s perfect.</p>

<h2 id="filtering">Filtering</h2>

<p>I strain first through a wire mesh strainer to remove the coarse grounds. The resulting product is still pretty gritty because of the fine particles. This goes through a pour-over coffee filter with a cone filter in it. Because the ground coffee absorbs water, I get about 600 mL of coffee concentrate after filtering.</p>

<h2 id="dilution">Dilution</h2>

<p>I like to dilute my coffee concentrate about 1:1 with water before adding ice. I use 6 oz (177 mL) of concentrate with 6 oz of water and then some ice to make a 12 oz drink.</p>

<h2 id="cost-is-95-cheaper">Cost is 95% Cheaper</h2>

<p>The cost of the coffee per 600 mL recipe is $0.49 (67 g * $10 / 1360 g). The cone filters are about $0.10 each. This breaks down to $0.17 per 177 mL concentrate to make one serving of coffee, a 95% discount from the iced coffee at Starbucks! In Hawaii, our sales tax is 4.5%, so the cost of homemade coffee is approximately the same as the sales tax on store-bought iced coffee.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the calculation:</p>

<pre><code class="language-r">coffee_price &lt;- 10/1360 # cost per gram
coffee_price_per_recipe &lt;- coffee_price * 67 # 67 g in 2/3 cup
volume_made_per_recipe &lt;- 600 # mL
serving &lt;- 177 # mL
filter_price &lt;- 0.10 # dollars
cost_per_serving &lt;- (coffee_price_per_recipe + filter_price) / volume_made_per_recipe * serving
cost_per_serving # in dollars
</code></pre>

<pre><code>## [1] 0.1748309
</code></pre>

<h2 id="discussion">Discussion</h2>

<p>Over one year, the savings is considerable. If we drank iced coffee only every other day, we would save $531.</p>

<p>Actually probably any coffee you can buy at the grocery store is going to be cheaper than Starbucks, so it&rsquo;s not a surprise. Even if you use coffee that&rsquo;s $20 for 10 oz (9 times more expensive than the Kirkland brand ground), it&rsquo;ll be cheaper ($1.63 per serving).</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Making iced coffee at home costs about $0.17 per serving, a savings of about 95% of the cost of having iced coffee at Starbucks.</p>
