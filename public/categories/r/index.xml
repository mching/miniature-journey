      <description>The podcast I listen to said something like, “I bet Justin Smoak must have one of the lowest BABIPs of anyone to this point in his career.” I thought it might be a good chance to explore this nebulous BABIP a little, what are the historical league and career trends in BABIP. Maybe 3 sentences are needed.
Or maybe a second paragraph. Or 2.

      <title>Work for Dinosaur Speed Geocache</title>

      <description>This is the work for the geocache we did today. The geocache description instructed us to measure the stride length and footprint length of some dinosaur tracks at the Dinosaur Ridge hike outside of Denver, Colorado. The kids and I looked at both the thinner Ornithomimus tracks and the thicker Iguanodontid tracks. Here’s the work, done in R:
First, set up a table of the data. The units for stride length and footprint length are meters.</description>

      <title>Reverse-In Parking in Hawaii and California</title>

      <description>Introduction One of my mainland-born friends is annoyed that Hawaii drivers like to reverse their cars into parking stalls much more than the mainland. My wife, who is also from the mainland, agreed with him enthusiastically. Whether this is appropriate parking behavior or not, I had never noticed it before, so I figured it was something I could test with some observations. I had a trip coming up to the mainland, and I was able to collect some data to test whether the Hawaii drivers were really so different than their California counterparts.</description>

      <title>Sorting photo directories with R and exiftool</title>

      <description>We were fans of Google&amp;rsquo;s Picasa photo organization software, but when it was discontinued, I decided that I would like to transfer all my digital photos onto an external drive and then into Adobe Lightroom. To do so, however, my &amp;ldquo;research&amp;rdquo; told me that it would be best to group them into catalogs based on year, mainly because I have on the order of 10^5 photos.
I had my pictures organized into about 300-400 directories by event.</description>

      <title>Rolling 3 Doubles in Monopoly</title>

      <description>Tonight my two kids and I were playing Monopoly. It’s a terrible, brutal game that usually ends in bad feelings, but for some reason they always want to play it. One of the rules of the game is that if you roll a double (e.g., two 2s), you get another turn. However, if you roll doubles three times in a row, you are sent to jail.
I wondered what was the probability of rolling 3 doubles in a row.</description>
