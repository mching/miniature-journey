<p>Recently I have been exploring the <strong>blogdown</strong> package to redo my website using <a href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo</a>, and it resurrected an old idea that I had. Security Now, one of my favorite podcasts, has transcriptions of each episode, and I thought it would be neat to put them into an e-book and read the old episodes that way. I tried using Calibre, but while it did work, I wasn’t able to figure out how to format it nicely. The creator of <strong>blogdown</strong>, Yihui Xue, has also written a packages called <strong>bookdown</strong> which looked like it had the right features to make a proper looking e-book.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(bookdown)
library(dplyr)</code></pre>

## [11] &quot;DESCRIPTION:  After catching up with a wild week of security events, we revisit a topic from the earliest episodes of the Security Now podcast:  Virtual Private Networks.  This coincides with the introduction of a new sponsor on the TWIT network, proXPN, a VPN provider that truly looks like the right choice.&quot;

>>>>>>> Stashed changes
<p>From what I could tell, the first 13 lines appear to be formatted as metadata. These would be helpful for formatting as header text for bookdown to work on.</p>
<p>Bookdown requires the first line of the file to be a chapter title with a first level heading. I think a useful format would be the title. Other metadata like Series and Archive could be discarded since would probably be the same for every file.</p>
<p>Conceptually for each transcript, I had to discard lines 1-3 and 9, and move the title to the top. The rest would probably be ok to stay for now. But what if episodes were not identically formatted like this? I should use regular expressions.</p>
