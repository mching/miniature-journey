<p>This week the local paper released a <a href="https://www.hawaiiprepworld.com/football/closing-the-book-2019-iolani-raiders/">season recap</a> of my alma mater’s football team. Included in the article was a link to <a href="https://www.hawaiiprepworld.com/iolani-football/statistics/">game results dating back to 1945</a>. It looked like there was an opportunity for a little data analysis on things like home and away records, records versus specific schools, etc.</p>
<p>I downloaded the data and cleaned it for analysis in Google Sheets.</p>

<p>Overall the dataset held data for 859 games with 13 variables.</p>
<div id="overall-records" class="section level1">
<h1>Overall Records</h1>
<p>I looked at the game results first. Overall the Iolani football team has a record of 448-356-21. That’s a winning percentage of 54.3%. Not bad!</p>
<div id="single-season-winning-percentage" class="section level2">
<h2>Single Season Winning Percentage</h2>
<p>I looked at the single season winning percentage and sorted the top seasons.</p>
<p>The top season was the 1968 team, which went 11-0-1 and won the Interscholastic League of Honolulu title. That team featured current Iolani teacher Chucky Nakoa!</p>

<p>There were a lot of games with “at” in their opponent names. To separate out the opponent name from the location, I looked for all rows that began with “at.” It turned out there were only 78 games starting with “at.” That’s less than 10% of games.</p>

<div id="stadium-location-and-neutral-field-games" class="section level2">
<h2>Stadium Location and Neutral Field Games</h2>
<p>I then looked at games with a stadium location. I had assumed that these games were neutral field games since a lot of them were at the island’s football stadium, Aloha Stadium. I looked to see how many games were played at a stadium and where these were. There were 585 games played at stadiums and only 274 without a label in the location.</p>

<p>Some of the games were played at schools so I wondered if those were actually games played against their hosts, rather than true neutral field games. By inspecting the data in Google Sheets I was able to confirm that all the games that were played at schools (e.g., Kaiser) were played against opponents from other schools (i.e., neutral field games).</p>
<p>Interestingly enough in 2005, Iolani played in the Tacoma Dome <a href="https://www.maxpreps.com/high-schools/iolani-raiders-(honolulu,hi)/football-fall-05/schedule.htm">against Capital High School (Washington)</a>, it was the first time Iolani had played an indoor football game and I assume the last since there aren’t any local places that you can play indoors here.</p>
<p>Here’s the neutral field record:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>iolani %&gt;% filter(grepl(&quot;[[:alpha:]]&quot;, iolani$stadium)) %&gt;%
  group_by(result) %&gt;%
  summarize(n())</code></pre>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 4 x 2
##   result `n()`

## 2 L        261
## 3 T         18
## 4 W        305</code></pre>
<p>At neutral fields, Iolani is 305-261-18, a winning percentage of 52.2%.</p>
</div>
<div id="home-games" class="section level2">
<h2>Home Games</h2>
<p>That left the home record to calculate. I filtered out the “at” and neutral field games to come up with the following result.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>homegames &lt;- iolani %&gt;% filter(!grepl(&quot;[[:alpha:]]&quot;, iolani$stadium))
homegames &lt;- homegames %&gt;% filter(!grepl(&quot;^at&quot;, homegames$opponent))

<p>At home Iolani is 107-60-2, a winning percentage of 63.3%!</p>
</div>
<div id="record-against-specific-schools" class="section level2">
<h2>Record against Specific Schools</h2>
<p>Calculating Iolani’s record against specific schools is complicated by the fact that the away games have “at” in their opponent names. To remove this I used a regular expression substitution.</p>

<h2>Top Receiving Yard Games</h2>
<p>Unlike the passing and rushing yard leaders, there are a lot of different names on this list. Carter Kamana finished his high school senior season this year. Keoni-Kordell Makekau plays Division 1 football at Navy. <a href="https://missoulian.com/sports/college/montana/raul-pacheco-s-biggest-play-wasn-t-a-pass-reception/article_6d520010-a875-11de-ae6a-001cc4c03286.html">Raul Pacheco</a> won the national championship at Montana and had the most receptions in Montana history until 2019.</p>

<h1>Discussion</h1>
<p>It was an interesting look back at Iolani football over the years. As a casual fan, I found some interesting stories and tidbits that I never knew, like that Tacoma game, or the fact that Raul Pacheco was the career leader in receptions at Montana for 20 years. I never knew about how successful Joe Igber was in college and I found out (again?) about the 1968 ILH champion team. It was also a pretty good way to brush off my <code>dplyr</code> skills. Iolani no ka oi!</p>
