<p>I made a <a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/2016/03/the-food-lab-vegan-experience-best-homemade-falafel.html">recipe</a> for falafel today that involved soaking dry garbanzo beans/chickpeas. I happened to have weighed the dry garbanzo beans before soaking to see how much I had. Before soaking I had 403 g beans. After soaking in tap water at 77 degrees F the weight was 795 g. The beans gained 392 g of water or 97.3% of their dry weight. That’s close enough to call it double! Next time I’ll try checking their weight along the soaking process to see what the curve looks like. By the way, the recipe came out great in the air fryer!</p>
