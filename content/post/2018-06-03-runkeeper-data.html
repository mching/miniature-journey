<p>Last summer I started running again after about 8 years off. I had run from my sophomore year of high school until the fall of 2008 when it seemed like I had a meniscus injury and I stopped running. I had run for 17 years, during which the longest break I had taken was maybe a few months. After I stopped, I always missed it, and when my son started training for a Scouting running achievement, I decided I would keep him company. Lo and behold my knee felt ok, so I figured I would keep going. I’ve been using the <a href="https://runkeeper.com/index">Runkeeper</a> app to track my runs and decided to look at what the data showed.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(dplyr))
library(ggplot2)
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(lubridate))</code></pre>
<p>I downloaded the data from the <a href="https://runkeeper.com/index">Runkeeper website.</a> It came as a zip file containing all my GPS tracks plus a processed csv file.</p>

<p>There was a lot of data there but I thought the first thing to start with would be my weekly mileage. I wanted to see how that changed over the last year.</p>

<h2>Correlation between Calories and Miles</h2>
<p>The app estimated calories per run. There was a linear correlation between calories and miles run, as displayed below.</p>

<p>This was a very linear relationship, even at the very extremes of the distances run. I fit a linear model and determined that a rough estimate of the energy expenditure rate was 136 calories per mile.</p>
