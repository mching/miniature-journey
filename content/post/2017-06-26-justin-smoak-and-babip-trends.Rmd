The podcast I listen to mentioned Justin Smoak's poor career BABIP numbers and I wondered how this fits in with people with as many AB as he has. 

```{r}
library(Lahman)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(hrbrthemes)
```


```{r}
data("Batting")
Batting %>% group_by(yearID) %>% 
  summarize(BABIP = (sum(H, na.rm = T) - sum(HR, na.rm = T))/
              (sum(AB, na.rm = T) - sum(SO, na.rm = T) - sum(HR, na.rm = T) + sum(SF, na.rm = T))) %>% 
  filter(yearID>1953) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = yearID, y = BABIP)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = "loess") +
  labs(title = "Batting Average on Balls in Play, 1953-2015",
       x = "Year",
       y = "BABIP") +
  theme_ipsum()
  

```
