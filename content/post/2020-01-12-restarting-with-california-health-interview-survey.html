<p>Lately this blog has had a lot of descriptive posts about my life but not much that stretches my R abilities. Later this year my organization is holding its research day, so I decided to start practicing on a dataset that I last used about 7 years ago. The <a href="https://healthpolicy.ucla.edu/Pages/home.aspx">California Health Interview Survey</a> is a survey of households that is weighted to be representative of the non-institutionalized population of California. This dataset has a few wrinkles in it that require a higher level of R programming so I thought I would try to stretch my rusty skills a little.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(dplyr)</code></pre>

<p>Fortunately when I last used this dataset in 2013, I had commented my code pretty well so I was able to remember how to load in the Stata file.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>chis &lt;- read.dta(&quot;/Users/mching/Dropbox/Mike/CHIS18/CHILD.dta&quot;, 
                 convert.dates = TRUE, convert.factors = TRUE, 
                 missing.type = TRUE, convert.underscore = TRUE, 
                 warn.missing.labels = FALSE)</code></pre>
<div id="unweighted-data" class="section level1">

<p>As you can see from above, the unweighted data were the same as in the data dictionary.</p>
</div>
<div id="weighted-data" class="section level1">
<h1>Weighted Data</h1>
<p>In the survey package you have to create a survey object that can be used to run the survey methods. Code for creating the survey object was nodified from AJ Damico’s <a href="http://asdfree.com/california-health-interview-survey-chis.html">Analyze Survey Data for Free</a> website.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>chis_design &lt;- 
    svrepdesign(

        repweights = &quot;rakedw[1-9]&quot; , 
        type = &quot;other&quot; , 
        scale = 1 , 
        rscales = 1 , 
        mse = TRUE 
    )</code></pre>
<p>I generated a quick table to see if the survey method for calculating the population estimates worked.</p>

<p>I checked it against <a href="http://ask.chis.ucla.edu/">AskCHIS</a>, the web interface to the CHIS dataset. Here’s what it returned for this variable:</p>

<p>The estimated population number of children who needed/didn’t neet care was exactly the same as what I calculated. The ratios were not the same because of all the inapplicable results.</p>

<p>Getting the weighted frequencies on just the yes or no responses was tricky. It required creating a variable for the Inapplicable patients and then creating a mean based on that.</p>

<p>The weighted means were the same as what AskCHIS said (yes = 4.3%, no = 95.7%). The confidence intervals were very slightly off from AskCHIS (yes = 2.5-6.2, no = 93.8-97.5) but I figured they were close enough to not matter too much.</p>
