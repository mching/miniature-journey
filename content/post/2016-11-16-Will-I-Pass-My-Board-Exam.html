<p>I am in the process of studying for my pediatrics board recertification and the pass rate is rumored to be about 75% of the questions correct. I got 163/199 (82%) of the questions correct on my practice exam. What is the probability that I will get at least 75% on my 200 question board exam based on this performance?</p>
<p>Here’s the exact binomial way to figure it out.</p>
<p>The idea is that if my probability of getting any question right is 0.82, what is the probability that I will be correct on at least 0.75 * 200 or 150 questions on the actual test?</p>
<pre class="r"><code>p &lt;- 163/199
n &lt;- 0.75 * 200
# In this case I needed to use `n - 1` because the upper tail does not include
# the actual boundary case.
pbinom(n - 1, 200, p, lower.tail = FALSE) </code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 0.994354</code></pre>
<p>It turns out I have a pretty good chance of passing!</p>
<p>We can also do this by simulation. Let’s run this simulation a million times and see how many times I would pass.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>sim &lt;- rbinom(1e6, 200, 163/199)
1 - sum(sim &lt; 150) / 1e6</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 0.994466</code></pre>
<p>This converges pretty well to the actual calculated solution. My test is on 11/21/16 and I’ll find out whether I pass a few days later… Here’s hoping that this analysis isn’t tempting fate!</p>
