<p>The school carnival was a couple weekends ago, and I volunteered at a game called Frog Bog. Players use a hammer to hit a lever that launches a frog at a rotating set of lily pads. You score by getting a frog in the lily pad. Players get four frogs per turn. I thought it might be nice to know the probability of success to help understand how to distribute prizes.</p>
<p>Here’s a video from a different carnival. We only have one rotating set of lily pads at our carnival.</p>

<p>Loading the data…</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(googlesheets)
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(dplyr))
library(binom)</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>my_sheets &lt;- gs_ls()
fb &lt;- gs_title(&quot;Frog_bog&quot;)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Sheet successfully identified: &quot;Frog_bog&quot;</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>x &lt;- gs_read(fb)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Accessing worksheet titled &#39;Sheet1&#39;.</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Parsed with column specification:
## cols(
##   Successes = col_double()
## )</code></pre>
<p>Here is what the raw data look like.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>x &lt;- tbl_df(x)
x</code></pre>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 48 x 1
##    Successes
##        &lt;dbl&gt;
##  1         0
##  2         0
##  3         0
##  4         0
##  5         0
##  6         0
##  7         0
##  8         0
##  9         1
## 10         0
## # … with 38 more rows</code></pre>
<p>Summarized in table form we have the number of times each outcome happened per game of 4 tries.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>table(x)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## x
##  0  1  2  3 
## 30 15  2  1</code></pre>
<p>To find the probability of success, we make a <b>big</b> assumption that success is completely random and independent of each player’s skill. The probability of a success on any one attempt is thus successes divided by attempts.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>attempts &lt;- nrow(x) * 4
successes &lt;- sum(x$Successes)
psuccess &lt;- successes/attempts</code></pre>
<p>Below I calculate the probability of 4, 3, 2, 1, and 0 successes per game.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>data.frame(successes = 0:4, p = dbinom(0:4, size = 4, prob = psuccess))</code></pre>
<pre><code>##   successes            p
## 1         0 0.6145974736
## 2         1 0.3181445746
## 3         2 0.0617574762
## 4         3 0.0053280960
## 5         4 0.0001723796</code></pre>
<p>If we want to take about 90% of the entry fee (return 10% to winners), we need to determine what each prize should be. If we have no prize for 0 frogs, you already are collecting 61.46% of the proceeds.</p>
<p>Let’s say we have a small prize for 1 success, valued at a small percentage of the entry fee. We would have a medium prize for 2 successes and a big prize for 3 successes. The grand prize could be much larger than the entry fee since it only happens about 1 in 5800 tries. I set the absolute dollar returns in the vector below.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>fractions &lt;- c(0, 0.1, 1, 3, 10)</code></pre>
<p>Here’s the expected payout, broken down by probability of successes in one 4 frog game.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>dbinom(0:4, size = 4, prob = psuccess) * fractions</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 0.000000000 0.031814457 0.061757476 0.015984288 0.001723796</code></pre>
<p>Overall expected payout per game would be then:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>sum(dbinom(0:4, size = 4, prob = psuccess) * fractions)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 0.11128</code></pre>
<p>That gets pretty close to the goal amount of proceeds. The actual entry fee was $2.50.</p>
<p>At a conservative estimate of one game per minute, over 10 hours per day, in a 2 day fair, that’s 1200 games. The game thus makes approximately $2866.46 or $143.32 per hour.</p>
