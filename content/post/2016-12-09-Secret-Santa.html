<p><a href="https://thepracticalr.wordpress.com/2016/12/07/secret-santa-picker-2-using-r/">A post about automating Secret Santa assignments</a> popped up in my Facebook feed the other day. This being the Christmas season, I took a look. It seemed a bit complex, and I wondered if I could make it more efficient.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://thepracticalr.wordpress.com/2016/12/07/secret-santa-picker-2-using-r/">original function</a> took in a list of people (e.g., Ann, Bill, Chris). Using a nested while-for loop, it randomly picked a name (Bill), and matched it to the first person in the list (Ann:Bill). If the same person was picked (Ann:Ann), it picked again to try to find another name. In the end it returned results like this:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; secret_santa(3, santas)
     [,1]    [,2]  [,3]   
[1,] &quot;Ann&quot;   &quot;has&quot; &quot;Bill&quot; 
[2,] &quot;Bill&quot;  &quot;has&quot; &quot;Chris&quot;
[3,] &quot;Chris&quot; &quot;has&quot; &quot;Ann&quot;  </code></pre>
<p>I guessed that another way to do it might be to just randomize the list and then have each person be assigned the next one on the list. This is what I came up with.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>secret_santa &lt;- function(santas) {
  random_santas &lt;- sample(santas) # Randomize santas
  recipients &lt;- random_santas[c(2:length(random_santas), 1)] # Move everyone down one
  gift_assignments &lt;- paste(random_santas, &quot;has&quot;, recipients) # Make readable list
  data.frame(sort(gift_assignments)) # Return alphabetically ordered list
}</code></pre>
<p>Here’s an example of how it works.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>set.seed(1)
santas &lt;- c(&quot;Maria&quot;, &quot;Tiffany&quot;, &quot;Mike&quot;, &quot;Bob&quot;, &quot;Josh&quot;, &quot;Melanie&quot;)
secret_santa(santas)</code></pre>
<pre><code>##   sort.gift_assignments.
## 1          Bob has Maria
## 2       Josh has Tiffany
## 3         Maria has Josh
## 4       Melanie has Mike
## 5           Mike has Bob
## 6    Tiffany has Melanie</code></pre>
<p>In doing more research on this problem, it turns out that the assignment of Secret Santas is related to the mathematical concept of derangements. From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derangement">Wikipedia</a>: “In combinatorial mathematics, a derangement is a permutation of the elements of a set, such that no element appears in its original position.”</p>
<p>The number of derangements of a set of size <em>n</em> can be calculated as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[!n=n!\sum _{i=0}^{n}{\frac {(-1)^{i}}{i!}}\]</span></p>
<p>My simplistic solution consists of one closed cycle of people (everyone just gives to the next person). However, there are also derangements such as A:B, B:A, C:D, D:C where you have a cycle of people that is 2 or more in length.</p>
<p>This could be something you would want to avoid. For example you could have a big family Secret Santa and a husband could be paired to his wife and vice-versa. My solution would avoid there being a small closed cycle like this, but it would still permit husband:wife.</p>
<p>My solution is a subset of the total possible derangements, and this begs the question, what percentage of all possible derangements are a cycle of the whole group?</p>
<p>A quick Google search brought up <a href="https://www.rose-hulman.edu/mathjournal/archives/2006/vol7-n1/paper5/v7n1-5pd.pdf">this paper</a> which in turn led me to <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/3622033">this paper</a>. My math skills are very rusty at this point, so I’m not sure what the answer is, but it seems that an exact solution can be calculated!</p>
