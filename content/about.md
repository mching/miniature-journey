I am a [developmental behavioral pediatrician](https://www.healthychildren.org/English/family-life/health-management/pediatric-specialists/pages/What-is-a-Developmental-Behavioral-Pediatrician.aspx) who works with children with a diversity of abilities. My official profile is on the [Kaiser Permanente Hawaii website](https://healthy.kaiserpermanente.org/hawaii/provider/michael-ching-7943547#/map). I am also involved in the [American Academy of Pediatrics, Hawaii Chapter](http://aaphawaii.org/). I like reading, the outdoors, photography, and taiko drumming.
